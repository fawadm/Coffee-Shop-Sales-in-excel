# Coffee-Shop-Sales-in-excel
“This is a Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard I designed to analyze key business metrics such as total sales, customer footfall, and category-wise performance. The goal was to provide quick insights for decision-making and to identify peak sales hours, top-performing products, and best-performing store locations.”

# “This dashboard was built using Excel. I applied pivot tables, slicers for interactivity, and dynamic charts. It’s fully interactive — users can filter by month or day to view trends.”

# “At the top, I’ve summarized four KPIs:
•	Total Sales: $698,812.33
•	Total Footfall: 149,116
•	Average Bill per Person: $4.69
•	Average Orders per Person: 1.4
# Orders by Hours

“This line chart shows how orders vary by time of day. As you can see, sales peak between 8 AM and 10 AM — typical morning coffee hours — and then gradually decline through the day.”

# Category-wise Sales

“The pie chart highlights that coffee contributes the most (39%), followed by bakery items and packaged chocolate. This helps in understanding where the main revenue comes from.”

# Size-wise Sales

“This pie chart breaks sales by cup size — Regular and Large sizes dominate equally, while Small and Undefined are minor segments.”

# Store-wise Sales

“Here I compared total sales and transactions across locations — Astoria and Hell’s Kitchen are top performers.”

# Top 5 Product Sales

“Barista Espresso and Brewed Black Tea are the most profitable products, showing customer preference for premium drinks.”

# Sales by Day of the Week

“This bar chart indicates that Friday and Monday are the busiest days, which helps plan staffing and inventory.”

# “From this analysis, we can conclude that the shop should:

Increase morning staff and inventory to meet 8–10 AM demand.

Focus marketing on premium coffee and bakery items.

Promote midweek offers to boost Tuesday–Thursday sales.

Use location-based insights to replicate successful store strategies elsewhere.”
